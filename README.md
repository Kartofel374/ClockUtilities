Clock utilities plugin is in beta, it may contain some bugs but they will eventually be fixed.




Clock utilities adds command /timer that creates timer with specified time to pass. When time passes, alarm rings to inform player that the time is over.

Command usage:

/timer <time in s> [time in m] [time in h]



permission:

clockUtilities.timer - allows to use /timer command (default)



This plugin is WIP, more content will be added soon. Please send your suggestions in the comments :)
